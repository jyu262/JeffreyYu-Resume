        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As an open-minded person, I enjoy listening to music of any type that just sounds good to me. I also enjoy watching anime, k-dramas, and spending time with friends. Working out is another activity I like to partake myself in as well. Food and playing video games are other subjects I am genuinely passionate about and love to talk about with others. I am willing to try new foods wherever I go to gain the experience and knowledge. Once in a while, I like to play video games with my friends to ease my stress or just to have a sense of progression outside of my in-real-life. There are a ton of things I enjoy doing but one activity that I love doing is socializing/talkin; these conversations can be deep and serious, which I appreciate, or just light-hearted talk with current news. It does not have to be new people but I am open to meeting new people. Learning about different experiences in anything in anyone's life peaks my interest since, most likely, I did not go through what they went through. Another thing I want to mention is spending time with family. I value my family as much as I value my friendships. But with family, it is something I can not find anywhere else. The relationships have been built up ever since I was born and that is why I love being with my family. Dogs are something cherish a lot. I have a dog and I am glad to have her because I gained the experience of taking care of one. For ninety nine percent of my life, I never had a dog but when my family got one last year, I discovered the high difficulty in taking care of one. Although it is difficult, dogs are able to provide happiness and a bond with the people they live. That is something that is worth it.<br><br>

       In terms of professional experience, I do not have much. But, I do have experience in volunteer work whether it is tutoring children, taking care of the disabled, or even setting up for local festivals by creating booths and posters. For the future, I would like to learn about the business world and how businesses work through professional experience.<br><br>

        I currently do not have any professional experience. However, I would like to apply and get into an internship in the next year or two to be able to gain professional experience in the field of business; it can range from marketing, finance, management etc. I want to find a concentration I want to focus on through research and in-person experiences. I see the field of business as an extremely practical major to have since I live in America, a capitalist country. To add on, financial literacy can be gained through years of school and research. I am able to give advice to my friends and family on business-related issues that they have no knowledge of in the future. With that, I can help a lot of people by giving them advice and making wise decisions based on their current situation. It helps me reinforce the knowledge I gained to recycle that information and have it ingrained in my mind.
